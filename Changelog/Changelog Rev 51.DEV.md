NOTES
-

We now have a new method for updating this should will all of the Vortex errors that we have been seeing.

## HOW TO UPDATE

**1**) Create a new Profile in Vortex and enable it.

**2**) Go to the [Collection](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/dfvt7o?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share_collection) page and ensure the most current revision number is displayed, then select select **"ADD TO VORTEX"**

**3**) When prompted to select which profile to install to, select the new profile you created in Step 1

**4**) Once the update is downloaded you can remove the old profile.

**NOTE** Don't worry you will **NOT** have to redownload the entire collection with this method.


This update addresses a few issues.

- We have abeen able to minimize stuttering when using the 2k Texture mods we have shaved of around 1gb of VRAM. Remember if you are using the 2k textures you need atleast 12Gb VRAM. If you are still experiancing stutters disable a few of the 2k Mods.
