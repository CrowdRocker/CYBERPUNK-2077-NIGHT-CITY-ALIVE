My Vision for all my Collections is for you to be able to play the game any way you want. I won't force you to play a certain way I want you to have the tools to create your own experience so you can get the most out of your game.

City of Dreams is the Ultimate experience you have access to everything you could ever need or want. Whether it's taking screenshots in photo mode, playing the most extreme difficulty, or cheating and hacking your way through Cyberpunk 2077 this collection has it all and I mean all.

The only choice you don't have is the Custom one-off body by the talented Hyst. The collection has a huge number of clothing options that are all built around this amazing 4k sculpted body. This body may not be for everyone so we have you covered you can check out our City of Dreams (lite) version if you would like to include your own clothing and custom body.

This is the true **"Play Your Way Collection"**, you have access to all the same great gameplay Mods from our main Collection, minus the custom body and clothing.

This collection is desighned to be used as a main base so you can add one of our modular Clothing Collections on top, giving you many diffrent options for how you want your V to look.
