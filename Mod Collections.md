City of Dreams (HEAVY) is the Ultimate experience you have access to everything you could ever need or want. Whether it's taking screenshots in photo mode, playing the most extreme difficulty, or cheating and hacking your way through Cyberpunk 2077 this collection has it all and I mean all.

The only choice you don't have is the Custom one-off body by the talented Hyst. The collection has a huge number of clothing options that are all built around this amazing 4k sculpted body. This body may not be for everyone so we have you covered you can check out our City of Dreams (lite) version if you would like to include your own clothing and custom body.
