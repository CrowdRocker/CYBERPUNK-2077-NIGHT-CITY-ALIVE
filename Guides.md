<summary>How to use Idle Anywhere</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)

**1**) Visit V's starting apartment in H10. You only need to do this once to 'activate' the mod.

**2**) Press the Sprint input while the following is true:

- Stood still (not sat, or crouched)
- Not in a moving elevator (probably can't be vehicle surf either)
- Out of combat
- Have empty hands
- Not looking directly up or down
- Not scanning (zooming is okay)

**3**) Press Sprint again to manually hide it.

*NOTE*
The menu will also not work when controlling surveilance systems, in Brain Dances, and shouldn't work in Johnny's memories either.
If you do have/use the option while in conversation with NPCs just be aware that it can sometimes cause NPCs to sound distant/quiet during the animation(s)

I've been building Pcs for a few years now and have picked up a few tips and tricks along the way. You can also check out my builds on our Discord.

I can connect to your Pc via a remote connection [Team Viewer]() and optimize your Pc for gaming. 

I use a few tools and methods which I will explain here. These tools/programs are lightweight and will not take up many resources in the background. These tools are used widely by the Pc community and are well known.

All links to these tools will be listed below so you can check them out for yourself.

All of this I offer free of charge. The only thing I ask is for you to **Endorse** and support our collections. It really means a lot to us.

This is an overclocking tool but it does much more. With this tool, I can set the following.

1) Custom fan curve this will help with **GPU** temps.

2) Unlock the voltage control on the **GPU** this helps maintain higher clock speeds for the **GPU**.



### RTSS Riva Statistics Tuner

This is a hardware monitoring tool that works alongside **MSI Afterburner**.

1) This allows monitoring of all **GPU** parameters including an **FPS** counter, Temp readings, **FPS** cap and much much more



### ISLC Intelligent Standby List Cleaner

This help to clear out the standby list in Windows in turn freeing up Memory **RAM** the benefits of this tool are fewer stutters in game and maintaining a steady fps.



### Quick CPU

### CPU Z & GPU z

These will allow you to identify the GPU and CPU.


### GEEK Uninstaller

This is a great tool for uninstalling programs and removing any traces they leave behind.


### WINDOWS OPTIMIZATION

As well as the tools i can install and configure there are also some optimizations I can perform inside of Windows itself.

These include.

1) Nvidia control panel optimizations

2) Bios optimizations.

3) Power management optimizations.

4) Game-specific optimizations.



### OVERCLOCKING OF THE GPU

I can overclock and stress test your **GPU**.



### As well as all of the above I can.

1) Clear out old unused Windows files taking up space on your System.

2) Run system scans to ensure everything is running as it should be and repair errors.

The game may crash here or there its just something we cyberpunks have to deal with. 

But if you are getting constant crashes then there is a issue let us know so we can assist you.

You may find that the game will crash when doing the following. This is due to the game compiling the scripts for all the mods.

1) After the first install of the collection.

2) After a "cyberclean"

3) After a collection update.

<summary>How to Downgrade Steam Games</summary>

![img](https://i.imgur.com/wAJUpeU.png)

1) Enable Steam Console
The first thing we'll do is enable the Steam Console. You'll want to have Steam running before proceeding. If you're downloading an older version of a paid game, you'll also want to be logged into an account that owns that game.
In order to enable the Steam Console, follow these steps.

First, hit the Win + R buttons to bring up the Run program. Type in the following string of text and hit enter:
steam://open/console
Steam will automatically open and display a new screen, titled Steam Console. Keep Steam open for now, and let's move over to your web browser for the next step.

2) Find App, Depot, and Manifest ID for Your Game**
The next part of this guide is going to require using SteamDB, or the Steam Database. Head over to the main page of SteamDB and search for the game you're looking to downgrade. We'll use Half-Life 2 as an example.
The first bit of information you'll want to grab is the App ID. Note this down somewhere, then click on the Depots link, found on the side of the page.

We want to note down the ID Number listed against the depot we're after.

What depot are we after? The depot for the base game. Two things that may indicate that the depot is for the base game are the size of the depot, as well as the name. If it's the largest depot, and it's named something like 'Base,' then in all likelihood that's the one we're after.

In our case, that would be Half-Life 2 Base. We should now have an App ID and a Depot ID. For Half-Life 2, we have 220 and 221 so far. Now, click the Depot ID itself. It will take you to yet another page.
Click Manifests on the side. This page is showing all the different updates, as well as how long ago those updates were released. You may need to sign in to SteamDB to see updates older than a year.
This page has the last piece of information we're after. Find the update you're after and note down the Manifest ID. Now we have everything we need.

In our case, that is the App ID 220, the Depot ID 221, and the Manifest ID we'll use is 2285219600326880043.

3) Download Manifest Using Steam Console**
Head back into Steam. The next part is easy. This is where we actually download the older version.

With the Steam Console open, input the following command.

download_depot <AppID> <Depot ID> <Manifest ID>
Again, our example would look something like this.

download_depot 220 221 2285219600326880043
After you hit enter, it may seem like nothing is happening. Steam won't always notify you of the download.

Don't worry, if you've entered the command correctly, Steam will be downloading it silently. You can confirm by checking any network usage. If you're worried about going over your data limit, make sure you know how to limit bandwidth and data usage in Windows.

Eventually, the Steam Console will display a message indicating that the download is done.

As long as you get the message Depot download complete, don't be too concerned with any error messages generated at this point.

Take note of where the download has been placed. There's another step or two involved to get your downgraded game running on Steam.

4) Replace Game Files With Downgraded Files**

Navigate to where Steam has downloaded your files. Keep this window open.

Next, open up the installation directory for your game. This can be done easily by following these steps:

Right-click the game on Steam.
Mouse over Manage.
Click Browse Local Files.
The two directories should look very similar.

From here, it's a matter of replacing the original game files with your newly downloaded version. Either move your original game files to another location for a backup, or outright delete the original files. Anything you delete can be downloaded again later.

Next, paste the files you downloaded from the Steam Console into the installation directory.

You've now downgraded the game files. Next time you launch the game through Steam, it will launch this original version.
