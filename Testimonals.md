"I just wanted to take the time to thank you, V2, for the effort you put into creating this modlist and for the incredible gaming experience it has provided. It brings me much closer to the gaming experience I always wanted to have with Vanilla.

 People probably don't realize the time and work it takes to find the right functional balance with so many mods. 

This modlist offers a unique and customizable gaming experience that has reignited my love for the game. I used to enjoy Night City a lot, and this modlist gives it a refreshing twist.

I also want to mention the work put into writing installation guides and tutorials, which are equally well-crafted with clear and concise explanations.

And one more thing, I haven't mentioned yet, but I also want to highlight the kindness and constant support present on this Discord community. Of course, I'm grateful to V2, but also to Fenrir, who took the time to answer my countless questions in recent days.

With that said, I must go now, I have a city to burn."


Fenrir:
"Seeing you succeed like this with a big collection is impressive. But being here with you on your journey just on the side is huge for a little nobody like myself. 

I remember when I told you that this collection will grow fast and I see new names here very often, just like I suspected. It‚Äôs an awesome collection with awesome people. 

HUGE respect to V2 for giving us his time to fix this collection with 700+ mods to work with so little issues is just AWESOME."


Fronky-Bot:
I'd also like to thank V2 for including a couple of my mods in the collection, and quite literally skyrocketing the downloads on them xD

"Thanks for all  the effort involved to make this collection. I have been enjoying it so far. Its hard sometimes to find collections that work with no issues but this one is top notch!! Great work."

"I would like to preface this by first of all thanking the lead behind this collection V2. And all their efforts for maintaining what often can be described as a rather complex and time consuming process, maintaining a collection of mods with a database this large is no easy task, but the dedication and willingness of this individual has made City of Dreams a "Go to" Collection for many, including myself . And with the ease of which the collection has worked as well.

I would also like to thank the staff of this discord for their dedication and expertise in helping solve a plethora of technical issues users can often experience, such is the nature of modding and pc's. Which it itself is no easy feat when you're dealing with potentially hundreds if not thousands of different PC configurations. 

Thank you also to the countless modders that without them would not make these collections possible at all. Their countless hours of testing and dedication to hundreds and hundreds of mods, and all for the love and passion of modding and sharing with the community. Making Cyberpunk even more enjoyable for us all. 

Thank you to CD Projekt RED for developing this game, and thank you to them for sticking with it and constantly improving the game over the course of time since it's launch, for without them no one us may even be here gathered today.

And also finally a thank you to the discord community for being helpful and pleasant and making the discord a great place for all to gather and talk and about share mods etc."
