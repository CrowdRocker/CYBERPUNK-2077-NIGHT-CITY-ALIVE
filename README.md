![](https://s11.gifyu.com/images/Uncutytitled.png)Hey, Chooms [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) here this is the [CITY OF DREAMS](https://) for **Cyberpunk 2077**.

<details><summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
Hey Chooms! My name is [v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/123334373) and i'm excited to meet you! I've fallen in love with Gaming and Modding and I'm sure you have too. Modding is really a cool way to add so much more to the games we already enjoy. But it's not always easy to get all those cool mods to work together with no issues. This inspired me to combine my passion for helping people, with a desire to make games that use mods, work as seamlessly as they can. I want it to be easier for you to jump right in, without having to worry if the mods will work. I curated a collection for [Hogwarts Legacy](https://next.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/collections/uehwil?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) for example, and that has been the most endorsed and downloaded collection on Nexus! My [Cyberpunk 2077](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/dfvt7o?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) collection is one of the most diversely comprehensive mod collections to date. Whether you love [Hogwarts](https://next.nexusmods.com/hogwartslegacy/collections/uehwil?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), [Cyberpunk](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/dfvt7o?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), [Starfield](https://next.nexusmods.com/starfield/collections/npk3lv?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), or even [Elden Ring](https://next.nexusmods.com/eldenring/collections/qpwypd?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection), I've got your back. And so does the community we've grown in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/xZNztPjA2u) when you have questions or just want to hangout with other like-minded gamers who want to get the most out of their games too!
</details>

<details><summary>MY VISION FOR THIS COLLECTION</summary>
My Vision for all my Collections is for you to be able to play the game any way you want. I won't force you to play a certain way I want you to have the tools to create your own experience so you can get the most out of your game.\
\
City of Dreams is the Ultimate experience you have access to everything you could ever need or want. Whether it's taking screenshots in photo mode, playing the most extreme difficulty, or cheating and hacking your way through Cyberpunk 2077 this collection has it all and I mean all.\
\
The only choice you don't have is the Custom one-off body by the talented Hyst. The collection has a huge number of clothing options that are all built around this amazing 4k sculpted body. This body may not be for everyone so we have you covered you can check out our [City of Dreams (lite)](https://next.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/collections/ayfbwl?utm_source=copy\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=share_collection) version if you would like to include your own clothing and custom body.

### OUSEN:

"I just wanted to take the time to thank you, V2, for the effort you put into creating this modlist and for the incredible gaming experience it has provided. It brings me much closer to the gaming experience I always wanted to have with Vanilla.

People probably don't realize the time and work it takes to find the right functional balance with so many mods.

This modlist offers a unique and customizable gaming experience that has reignited my love for the game. I used to enjoy Night City a lot, and this modlist gives it a refreshing twist.

I also want to mention the work put into writing installation guides and tutorials, which are equally well-crafted with clear and concise explanations.

And one more thing, I haven't mentioned yet, but I also want to highlight the kindness and constant support present on this Discord community. Of course, I'm grateful to V2, but also to Fenrir, who took the time to answer my countless questions in recent days.

With that said, I must go now, I have a city to burn."

### Fenrir:

"Seeing you succeed like this with a big collection is impressive. But being here with you on your journey just on the side is huge for a little nobody like myself.

I remember when I told you that this collection will grow fast and I see new names here very often, just like I suspected. It‚Äôs an awesome collection with awesome people.

HUGE respect to V2 for giving us his time to fix this collection with 700+ mods to work with so little issues is just AWESOME."

### Jinxy ùì©ùì∏ùì∂ùì´ùì≤ùìÆ Hyperdrive:

"I would like to preface this by first of all thanking the lead behind this collection V2. And all their efforts for maintaining what often can be described as a rather complex and time consuming process, maintaining a collection of mods with a database this large is no easy task, but the dedication and willingness of this individual has made City of Dreams a "Go to" Collection for many, including myself . And with the ease of which the collection has worked as well.

I would also like to thank the staff of this discord for their dedication and expertise in helping solve a plethora of technical issues users can often experience, such is the nature of modding and pc's. Which it itself is no easy feat when you're dealing with potentially hundreds if not thousands of different PC configurations.

Thank you also to the countless modders that without them would not make these collections possible at all. Their countless hours of testing and dedication to hundreds and hundreds of mods, and all for the love and passion of modding and sharing with the community. Making Cyberpunk even more enjoyable for us all.

Thank you to CD Projekt RED for developing this game, and thank you to them for sticking with it and constantly improving the game over the course of time since it's launch, for without them no one us may even be here gathered today.

And also finally a thank you to the discord community for being helpful and pleasant and making the discord a great place for all to gather and talk and about share mods etc."
