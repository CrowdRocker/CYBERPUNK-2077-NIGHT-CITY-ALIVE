**Premium Users**: Takes 1.5 hours + Semi-automatic. You can be AFK with a few Install menus at the end of the installation.\
**Free Users:** Takes 2 to 2.5 hours + Semi-automatic. You will have to click on download for each mod one by one.

### Alternative Midair Movement and Walljumping

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtPB9BjaAbE

[Alternative Midair Movement and Walljumping](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/5160?tab=description) by [DemiGoD715](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/users/30144935).

### Features

> Allows the player to control the character midair while jumping and double jumping (no different types of leg cyberware supported yet). Adds "wallbouncing/walljumping" inspired by an Apex Legends movement mechanic, which means you can bounce back from a wall when directly looking at it and pressing/holding jump. Made the player slow down in the air if not pressing any movement keys to allow for a lot more precise landing than vanilla. Controller is supported and most things are configurable with [Native Settings UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3518)

**How to wall jump all**dialogue jumping.

Wall jumping is triggered when the player is:

1. in the air.
2. looking directly forward at a solid surface that is right in front of the player character.
3. holding down the jump button.

- You need to stop moving forward (let go of the forward key or pull back the analog stick) in order to not go back directly at the wall right after the wall jump.
- You can instantly redirect your wall jump in a backward diagonal left/right direction if you press the left or right movement keys at the moment you wall jump.
- Redirecting the wall bounce direction is possible in general with camera positioning and movement keys, similar to the regular midair movement (its strength is boosted to feel more fluid, but it needs some practice to get the hang of it)

**Walljump usage with a **jump all double** jump:**

- If you don't want to double jump at all, \*\*HOLD \*\*the jump button from the ground to only wall jump.
- If you want to double jump after a wall jump, \*\*HOLD \*\*the jump button from the ground -> wall jump -> release the jump key -> press the jump key again to double jump.
- Double jump will be used up when pressing instead of holding the jump key, but I compensated this by increasing the jump height, so it becomes a feature instead of a bug.\\

**How to control midair movement:**

- As a general rule of thumb, you'll be able to push the character in the direction you are pressing the movement keys and turning the camera affects the direction too.
- After jumping hold Forward + Left/Right and turn your mouse in the same direction to make a wide arc.
- After jumping let go of Forward and hold Left/Right and turn your mouse in the same direction to make a sharper turn.
- With source engine movement you can also tap strafe, which is rapidly pressing the movement keys in the air to drastically change your movement direction.
- If you let go of every movement key (WASD) the character will start slowing down, you can also slow down faster by moving backwards but keep in mind the character will actually start moving backwards once the forward momentum is gone.
